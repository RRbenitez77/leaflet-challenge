Here i created a dashboard that visualizes earthquake occurrances,GeoJson with Leaflet to encode georgrapic data structures.

 U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) site was used to source the data, the USGS provides earthquake data in different formats, updated every 5 minutes. On the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and when we click on 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', it gives a JSON representation of that data.


Imported & Visualized the Data.

Created a map using Leaflet that plots the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.

Vistualized data reflects the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color the insert scale indicates the magnatude of Earthquakes.


Created a legend that will provide context for the map data.
